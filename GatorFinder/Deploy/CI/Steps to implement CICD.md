What is CI/CD

CI/CD stands for continuous integration and continuous deployment or delivery. It is a modern development approach that automates building, testing, and deploying applications to improve speed, quality, and reliability.

Why CI/CD

Faster development cycles by automating builds and deployments  
Early bug detection through automated testing  
Consistent and repeatable deployments  
Improved collaboration across teams  
Scalable infrastructure through standardized workflows

DevOps Knowledge Required Before Implementing CI/CD

Understand your app stack: 
React frontend, Go backend, AWS RDS for the database  
Use Git for source control with structured branching and pull request workflows  
Define and execute build and test commands for both frontend and backend  
Dockerize both services using optimized, multi-stage Dockerfiles  
Use Jenkins (or an alternative) for pipeline orchestration  
Deploy to Kubernetes clusters (local for dev, EKS for production)  
Securely manage secrets using Kubernetes Secrets or HashiCorp Vault  
Use Terraform for Infrastructure as Code  
Use Ansible for configuration management and provisioning  
Implement monitoring and alerting with Prometheus and Grafana  
Write Python scripts for automation and orchestration

Production-Ready CI/CD Pipeline with Advanced DevOps Integration

1. Source code checkout  
Jenkins pulls the latest code from the Git repository when a push or pull request occurs

2. Dependency installation  
Frontend: npm install  
Backend: go mod tidy

3. Build  
Frontend: npm run build to generate static assets  
Backend: go build to compile the binary

4. Testing  
Frontend: npm test  
Backend: go test ./...  
Collect test reports and code coverage

5. Linting and static analysis  
Frontend: eslint  
Backend: go vet, golint, staticcheck  
Enforce quality checks and fail builds if necessary

6. Docker image build  
Build optimized Docker images for frontend and backend using multi-stage Dockerfiles

7. Push to container registry  
Push images to AWS ECR or another container registry, tagged by commit hash or version

8. Feature flags management  
Connect to LaunchDarkly, Unleash, or custom feature flag system  
Enable or disable features without redeploying  
Control rollout by user segments or percentages

9. Infrastructure provisioning with Terraform  
Use Terraform to create and manage AWS resources including EKS, RDS, IAM, networking  
Store Terraform state securely in remote backends like S3

10. Configuration management with Ansible  
Use Ansible playbooks to configure Jenkins, install agents, or set up supporting services  
Ideal for VMs, EC2 instances, or bare-metal servers

11. Deploy to Kubernetes  
Use kubectl apply or Helm charts to deploy services to the EKS cluster  
Implement rolling updates, auto-scaling, ingress routing, and service discovery

12. Post-deployment testing  
Perform smoke tests to ensure the application is responding correctly  
Validate API endpoints, database connectivity, and UI health

13. Feature toggle activation  
Gradually enable new features via the flag system  
Monitor performance and user feedback during staged rollouts

14. Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana  
Track resource usage, latency, error rates, and custom metrics  
Set up dashboards and alerts for application and infrastructure monitoring

15. Centralized logging  
Use tools like Loki, Elasticsearch, or CloudWatch Logs to aggregate logs  
Ensure logs are searchable and persistently stored

16. Python automation  
Use Python scripts for batch jobs, post-deploy verifications, report generation, or integration with APIs  
Automate recovery, rollback, or routine operational tasks

17. Notifications  
Integrate with Slack, email, or dashboards to notify stakeholders of pipeline status, test results, and alerts  
Include helpful metadata like build numbers, commit IDs, and coverage stats

18. Rollback strategy  
Use Helm rollback or kubectl rollout undo to revert to a previous version  
Toggle off broken features using feature flags instantly  
Restore previous Docker images in production quickly
